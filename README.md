<h1>User Inquiry Form</h1>

This project is a simple user inquiry form application where users can submit, update, and delete their details (name, email, phone number, and message). The submitted inquiries are stored in a MongoDB database and can be viewed, updated, or deleted by the user in real time.


<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

• ReactJS: For building the front-end user interface. 

• Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment used for the back-end. 

• Express: A web framework for Node.js used to handle routing and server logic. (Answer to your question: Express is a framework, not a library.) 

• MongoDB: NoSQL database used to store user inquiries. 

• MongoDB Compass: GUI for managing and interacting with the MongoDB database. 

• TailwindCSS: Utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs. 

• DaisyUI: Component library for TailwindCSS to speed up UI development.
